Hello! Here is how to operate the code:

1. Run the program
2. Enter your first guess of a random 3-digit number
3. You will be provided with a hint telling you if the goal is higher or lower than your guess
4. You will be asked if you want another hint. Please enter "y" or "n".

**If you enter "y":**

The output will show you a combination of 3 signs: ↑, ↓, or =. The placement of each sign corresponds with each digit of the number.

↑ means that you should guess higher (your guessed digit is lower than the goal)

↓ means that you should guess lower (your guessed digit is higher than the goal)

= means that you should not change this digit (your guessed digit is correct)

For example:

\*Goal: 639
\*Guess1: 159
\*Hint Output: ↑ ↓ =

After this, you will be asked again if you want a 3rd hint. Please enter "y" or "n".

If you enter "y":

The output will tell you whether the goal is an even or odd number.

Following this, please continue guessing.

**If you enter "n":**

No extra hints will be provided and you will prompted to enter your next guess.

That is all, hope you enjoy!
